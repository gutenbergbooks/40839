  <p class="dialogue">I’m much in the same case. Since he came up to town,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> I’ve only called upon him once before. By Jove, it was enough. Such a set as I met here!</p>

  <p class="dialogue">I understood that he was up the river.</p>

  <p class="spkr">COLONEL.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Came back yesterday. Hope it’s done him good. After all, he’s my nephew, and I mean to knock the nonsense out of him.</p>

  <p class="spkr">SYLVESTER.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Colonel, you’re very proud of him; and you have every reason to be. From all I hear, few men have won more distinction at Oxford.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Does it mean anything? That is the sort of jargon<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span> Gerald was full of, when I saw him last. But he’ll get over it. Intellectual measles. Oxford’s a fine place, but no mental drainage.</p>

  <p class="spkr">SYLVESTER.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">I can form no opinion. I hadn’t the advantage of a university training.</p>

  <p class="spkr">COLONEL.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">I had. I was rusticated. We Cazenoves always were—till Gerald’s time. But he’ll redeem himself. We Cazenoves have always been men, except one. That’s my sister, Caroline; and, by Jove, she’s the next best thing—a woman.</p>

Yes, you are right; I too am different; I see things from a different point of view. And when I think of Margery’s young life, so full of hope and joy—Margery, who never asked to be my wife—Margery, whom I compelled to marry me—with all the joy crushed out of her—I feel too much ashamed even to ask forgiveness. And as I watch her move about the house—silent and sorrowful—I ask myself, how much did Margery give up for me? I took her from the station of life in which she was born, and in which she was happy. I set her in another and a strange one. Was mine the only sacrifice? How much of friendship and of old association did she resign for my sake? My life continued as it was before—I had my old friends and my old pursuits. What had she? Nothing—but my love. And I took it away from<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-78">[Pg 78]</a></span> her. Because she made a few mistakes, and a few people laughed—a few more didn’t call—and I mistook a light heart for an empty head.

It’s well to know the truth; but, Gerald dear, why didn’t you tell it me instead of her? Why didn’t you tell me I was no companion? I would have gone away. But to pretend you loved me, when you didn’t—to let me go on thinking you were happy, when all the time you were regretting your mistake—not to tell <i>me,</i> and to tell someone else—oh, it was cruel, when I loved you so!</p>

    <p>This transcription is based on images scanned by Google from a copy made available by the Princeton University Library.</p>

    <p>The following changes to the text were noted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the text, dashes at the end of lines have been normalized.</li>

      <li>p. 31: <i>Re-enter <span class="name">Margery,</span> <span class="normal">R.,</span> she goes straight…</i>—Changed comma after “R.” to semicolon.</li>

      <li>p. 46: We musn’t make so much noise.—Changed “musn’t” to “mustn’t” as “mustn’t” is the preferred spelling elsewhere in the text.</li>

      <li>p. 63: <i>Enter <span class="name">Mrs. Sylvester,</span> she hesitates, on seeing <span class="name">Lady Wargrave.</span></i>—Changed comma after <span class="name">“Sylvester”</span> to semicolon.</li>

      <li>p. 78: Yes, Mrs. Sylvester, its best—Changed “its” to “it’s”.</li>

      <li>p. 84, last line: It was enough—Added period to end of sentence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made, particularly in the handling of stage directions enclosed by brackets on one side. When these fit on a line, they were printed flush right. When they did not, they were printed on the next line. For the purposes of this transcription, these stage directions were all placed on the next line, indented the same amount from the left margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>
